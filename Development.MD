# Week of 11/16/20:

  During this week, our group met up virtually to deliberate on our project based on the given datasets and have decided to use the Openflights dataset to simulate scenarios where people can travels from point A to B without stopping at major hub airports. During this meeting we discussed different algorithms and came up with both our contracts, project goals, and delegated tasks among ourselves. During that week, some progress was made creating the graph data structure, particularly the graph.h file. Research was also done on different implementations as well as the algorithms we need for this project.

# Week of 11/23/20:

  During this week, mild progress was made creating the graph data structure, and some of the methods needed were written up. There was some confusion as to how to store edges and vertices, but eventually we settled on an adjacency list among other things. There was also progress researching algorithms needed for this project (Betweeness centrality, Djikstra's). Aside from that, Thanksgiving was great, and got some good Black Friday Deals.

# Week of 11/30/20:

  During this week, we completed our graph implementation along and started building our Makefile to ensure our code compiles so far as well as our main.cpp file. We plan to add test cases into the Makefile and incorporate datareading code. We also met with Stav to discuss our progress in the project.
