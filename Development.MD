# Week of 11/16/20:

  During this week, our group met up virtually to deliberate on our project based on the given datasets and have decided to use the Openflights dataset to simulate scenarios where people can travels from point A to B without stopping at major hub airports. During this meeting we discussed different algorithms and came up with both our contracts, project goals, and delegated tasks among ourselves. During that week, some progress was made creating the graph data structure, particularly the graph.h file. Research was also done on different implementations as well as the algorithms we need for this project.

# Week of 11/23/20:

  During this week, mild progress was made creating the graph data structure, and some of the methods needed were written up. There was some confusion as to how to store edges and vertices, but eventually we settled on an adjacency list among other things. There was also progress researching algorithms needed for this project (Betweeness centrality, Djikstra's). Aside from that, Thanksgiving was great, and got some good Black Friday Deals.

# Week of 11/30/20:

  During this week, we completed our graph implementation along and started building our Makefile to ensure our code compiles so far as well as our main.cpp file. We plan to add test cases into the Makefile and incorporate datareading code. We also met with Stav to discuss our progress in the project. After meeting with Stav to see where we are headed with this project, we went ahead and completed implementing data reads and created both a dataset and airport class for us to store routes.dat and airports.dat in. Starting implementations of the BFS/Djikstra's algorithm have been made with sufficient progress.

# Week of 12/7/20:

  During this week, the data handling process has been accomplished and test cases have been written. Last minute touches are being added to the BFS/Djikstra's algorithm and betweeness centrality. We completed test cases, and created a command interface for the user to run with the program. We finished our presentation video as well finalized our results documentation and other important categories. It is safe for us to say now that our project is now complete.
